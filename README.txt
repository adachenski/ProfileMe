#ProfileMe

*The project is a small application for building personal websites. The User can view and change the 
*look of the web page. But if he wants to save the changes he has to create an account. The User will 
*be able to create a personal website and use it whatever it is for blogging or a small business.

*The ProfileMe App will strongly rely on the 2-way data binding from Angular 1.5. -The user can 
*create account and login. -Every user can create a personal web page which after login the changes 
*will be saved and the user can share the created link for showing off his blog or website. 
*-The created link will be accessible from anyone. -The created web page will be easy to modify 
*from the person who owns the account. which make it perfect for small business. So the owner can 
*update his site info at all the time. -The person who created the account can receive 
*comments from other logged in users. He can select and delete comments that he think are not 
*appropriate for his web page.
